# Vehicle_Management_System
A vehicle management system is a software application designed to manage vehicles' operations. The system provides a centralized database for storing all vehicle-related data, allowing administrators to manage the vehicles efficiently. In this project, we will implement the Vehicle Management System using assembly language. 
# Working
The vehicle management system works by storing all the data related to the vehicles in a centralized database. The system is accessible through a user interface, allowing authorized users to access the data from the computer. The system provides several features that allow administrators to manage the vehicles efficiently. These features include:

1. Vehicle tracking - The system allows administrators to track the vehicles' location, making it easier to manage the fleet.

2. Maintenance scheduling - The system allows administrators to schedule maintenance for each vehicle based on its usage, ensuring that the vehicles are always in good condition.

3. Fuel management - The system allows administrators to track fuel usage and expenses, making it easier to manage the fleet's fuel expenses.

4. Repair management - The system allows administrators to track repairs and maintenance expenses for each vehicle, making it easier to manage the fleet's repair expenses.
# Features
The Vehicle Management System comes with the following features:
- Maintenance scheduling: Allows users to schedule regular maintenance tasks such as oil changes and tire rotations.
- Fuel tracking: Allows users to track fuel consumption and expenses.
- Repair records: Allows users to keep track of repair records for their vehicles.
- Expense tracking: Allows users to track expenses related to their vehicles, including repairs and maintenance.
- Vehicle information: Allows users to store information about their vehicles, including make, model, and year.
# Scope
The scope of this project is to implement a Vehicle Management System using Assembly Language. The system will provide the features of vehicle tracking, maintenance scheduling, fuel management, and repair management. The system will be able to store vehicle-related data in a centralized database and allow authorized users to access the data from the computer. The project aims to provide a user-friendly interface and efficient management of the vehicles.
